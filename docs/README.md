# Project Overview

## What We've Done

- **Extracted .tar Archives**: We've successfully extracted `.tar` archives, which has provided access to essential data.
- **Utilized Official Tools**: We're using an official `tar` extractor and various Python scripts, enhancing our workflow.
- **Accessed Multiple Versions**: We've gained access to multiple server and client versions for our analyses.

## Tools We Have

- **Tar Extractor**: Extracts `.tar` files.
- **Python Scripts**: We haven't looked much into them but they're for `.ani` files

## Current Challenges

We need help with unpacking and understanding the following file formats:

- **.es Files**
- **.ani Files**
- **.asd Files**

## Get Involved

We need expertise in handling `.es`, `.ani`, and `.asd` files. If you have experience with these or can develop tools to manage these formats, please consider contributing.
